# Comprehensive Hadoop HDFS Cheatsheet

## What is HDFS?
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant file system designed for storing and processing large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to data and is optimized for large files with streaming data access patterns.

## Architecture Overview
HDFS follows a **master-slave architecture**:
- **NameNode (Master)**: Manages the filesystem namespace, metadata, and block locations. It does not store actual data.
- **DataNode (Slave)**: Stores actual data blocks and handles read/write requests. Reports block status to NameNode periodically.
- **Secondary NameNode**: Assists NameNode by checkpointing edits and fsimage files (not a hot standby).
- **Client**: Interacts with NameNode for metadata and directly with DataNodes for data I/O.

Files are split into **blocks** (default 128 MB) and replicated across DataNodes (default replication factor: 3) for fault tolerance.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Block** | Fixed-size chunk of a file (128 MB or 256 MB default). Enables parallel processing. |
| **Replication** | Copies of blocks stored on multiple DataNodes for reliability (configurable per file/directory). |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Automatic block replication and re-replication if a DataNode fails. |
| **Rack Awareness** | Placement policy to minimize network traffic by preferring blocks on the same rack. |
| **Erasure Coding** | Space-efficient alternative to replication for cold data (e.g., RS-3-2 policy). |
| **Snapshots** | Point-in-time copies of directories for backup/recovery. |
| **Federation** | Multiple independent NameNodes to scale namespace. |
| **High Availability (HA)** | Active-standby NameNodes with shared storage (e.g., Quorum Journal Manager). |

## Common Configurations
Edit `hdfs-site.xml` for cluster-wide settings. Key parameters:

# HDFS NameNode: Detailed Overview

The NameNode is the cornerstone of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), acting as the master server in its master/slave architecture. It manages the filesystem namespace, metadata, and access control without handling actual data transferâ€”user data flows directly between clients and DataNodes. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of its role, components, operations, and interactions.

## Role and Responsibilities
- **Central Authority**: The NameNode maintains the entire filesystem namespace in memory, including the hierarchical structure of directories and files, file permissions, quotas, and mappings of files to data blocks.
- **Access Regulation**: It authorizes client operations (e.g., open, close, rename) and directs clients to the appropriate DataNodes for data I/O.
- **Block Coordination**: Tracks block locations across DataNodes, enforces replication factors (default: 3), and ensures fault tolerance through re-replication.
- **No Data Storage**: It stores only metadata (typically a few GB for large clusters), not the actual data blocks.

Key design principle: User data never passes through the NameNode, enabling high-throughput streaming access.

## Filesystem Namespace
HDFS supports a Unix-like hierarchical namespace:
- Operations: Create/delete/rename files and directories, set permissions/quotas.
- Limitations: No hard/soft links or random writes (append-only for files).
- Reserved Paths: System paths like `/.reserved` (for internal use) and `.snapshot` (for backups).

The namespace is kept fully in memory for fast access, with persistence handled separately (see below).

## Metadata Management
The NameNode stores two main types of metadata:
- **Namespace Metadata**: Directory/file hierarchy, permissions, modification times.
- **Block Metadata**: File-to-block mappings, block locations (DataNode IDs), replication factors.

This metadata is loaded into memory on startup and updated in real-time for all operations.

## Persistence Mechanisms: FsImage and EditLog
To ensure durability and recoverability, the NameNode uses a dual-file persistence model:

| Component | Description | Storage | Role in Operations |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **FsImage** | Persistent snapshot of the filesystem namespace and block mappings at a point in time. | Local disk (e.g., `dfs.namenode.name.dir`). | Loaded on startup; serves as the base for recovery. |
| **EditLog** | Sequential, append-only transaction log recording every metadata change (e.g., file creation, replication updates). | Local disk (same directory as FsImage). | Appended synchronously for each operation; ensures atomicity. |

### How Persistence Works
1. **On Startup**: NameNode loads the latest FsImage into memory, then replays the EditLog to apply recent changes.
2. **During Runtime**: All mutations (e.g., writes) are appended to the EditLog and reflected in memory immediately.
3. **Checkpointing**: Periodically (configurable via `dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period` or after `dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns` transactions):
   - Merge EditLog into FsImage to create an updated snapshot.
   - Truncate the EditLog (old entries are now in FsImage).
   - This reduces recovery time on restart by minimizing EditLog replay.

Without checkpointing, EditLogs can grow large, slowing startups. Multiple copies of these files can be configured for redundancy.

## Secondary NameNode
The Secondary NameNode is a helper daemon (not a hot standby):
- **Functions**:
  - Downloads FsImage and EditLog from the active NameNode periodically.
  - Merges them into a new FsImage (offloads checkpointing from the primary).
  - Uploads the updated FsImage back.
- **Configuration**: Runs on a separate machine; sync interval via `dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir`.
- **Limitations**: It cannot take over if the primary failsâ€”it's for maintenance, not HA. For failover, use HDFS High Availability (HA) with active/standby NameNodes and shared storage (e.g., Quorum Journal Manager).

In production, Secondary NameNode is often combined with HA setups.

## Block Management
Blocks (default 128 MB) are the unit of storage and parallelism:
- **Mapping**: NameNode maintains an in-memory map of file blocks to DataNode locations.
- **Replication**:
  - Ensures the specified number of replicas per block.
  - Placement policy (rack-aware): For factor=3, prefers 2 replicas on the same rack, 1 on another for fault tolerance.
- **Under-Replicated/Over-Replicated Handling**: Automatically triggers re-replication or deletion as needed.

| Replication Scenario | Placement Strategy |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Factor = 3 | 1 local rack (writer's node), 1 same rack, 1 remote rack. |
| Factor > 3 | Additional replicas distributed to avoid rack overload. |
| Hot/Cold Data | Uses storage policies (HOT: SSD; COLD: archival) for placement. |

## Interactions with DataNodes and Clients
Communication uses TCP/IP and RPC protocols:
- **With Clients**:
  - Client requests metadata (e.g., block locations) via the Client Protocol.
  - NameNode responds with DataNode addresses; client then reads/writes directly to DataNodes.
- **With DataNodes** (DataNode Protocol):
  - **Heartbeats**: DataNodes send every few seconds to report liveness. Missing heartbeats mark a node as dead.
  - **Block Reports**: Sent periodically (or on startup) listing all stored blocks. NameNode uses this to update its block map.
  - **Commands**: NameNode issues instructions like "replicate block X to node Y" via RPC responses.

The NameNode is reactiveâ€”it responds to requests but doesn't initiate connections.

## Safemode and Startup
- **Safemode**: Entered on startup or after failover. No mutations (e.g., replication) occur until:
  - A configurable percentage of blocks are reported (via Block Reports).
  - A 30-second grace period passes.
- **Exit Command**: `hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave` (admin only).
- Purpose: Ensures metadata consistency before allowing writes.

## High Availability (HA) and Robustness
- **Single Point of Failure Mitigation**: Use HA with:
  - **Active/Standby NameNodes**: Shared EditLog via JournalNodes (QJM) or NFS.
  - **Failover**: Automatic (ZKFailoverController) or manual (`hdfs haadmin -failover`).
- **Failure Handling**:
  - NameNode Crash: Standby takes over using shared logs.
  - DataNode Failure: Detect via heartbeats; re-replicate affected blocks.
- **Integrity**: Clients verify data with checksums; metadata uses CRC for corruption detection.
- **Scalability**: Federation allows multiple independent NameNodes for namespace partitioning.

## Monitoring and Best Practices
- **Web UI**: Access at `http://namenode:9870` for namespace browser, reports, and logs.
- **Logs**: Check `hadoop-hdfs-namenode*.log` for EditLog/FsImage issues.
- **Tuning**: Increase `dfs.namenode.edits.journaltail` for faster tailing in HA.
- **Backup**: Regularly snapshot metadata directories; use tools like `hdfs oiv` to inspect FsImages.

This setup makes the NameNode highly reliable for petabyte-scale data, balancing performance and durability. For production, always enable HA to avoid downtime.

# HDFS Snapshots: Detailed Guide

HDFS Snapshots provide a mechanism for creating read-only, point-in-time copies of directories (or the entire filesystem namespace). They are lightweight, space-efficient backups that do not duplicate data blocks but instead reference existing ones via metadata. This makes them ideal for data protection, recovery from errors, and auditing changes without impacting performance.

## Key Benefits
- **Instantaneous Creation**: O(1) time complexity; no data copying occurs.
- **Space Efficiency**: Only modified data after snapshot creation incurs additional storage (copy-on-write semantics).
- **Fault Tolerance**: Helps recover from accidental deletions, overwrites, or corruptions.
- **No Disruption**: Regular HDFS operations (reads/writes) proceed unaffected.

Snapshots are stored under a reserved `.snapshot` directory and are accessible like any other HDFS path.

## How Snapshots Work
Snapshots leverage HDFS's metadata structure in the NameNode:

1. **Creation**: The NameNode records the current state of the directory's metadata (file lists, block mappings, sizes) without altering DataNodes.
2. **Viewing a Snapshot**: When accessing a snapshot path (e.g., `/dir/.snapshot/s1/file`), the NameNode reconstructs the view by applying a "reverse delta" â€“ subtracting post-snapshot modifications from the current state.
3. **Modifications Post-Snapshot**:
   - Changes (e.g., edits, deletions) are tracked in a delta log.
   - New blocks for modified files are created on DataNodes (copy-on-write).
   - Memory overhead: O(M), where M is the number of modified files/directories since the snapshot.
4. **Deletion**: Removes the metadata reference; actual data blocks are garbage-collected if unreferenced elsewhere.

This design ensures minimal overhead: No block replication during creation, and deltas are compact.

| Workflow Step | NameNode Action | DataNode Action | Client Impact |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Snapshot Creation** | Record metadata snapshot. | None. | Instantaneous. |
| **File Read from Snapshot** | Reconstruct via deltas. | Serve existing blocks. | Transparent. |
| **File Modification** | Update current metadata; log delta. | Allocate new blocks for changes. | Normal write latency. |
| **Snapshot Deletion** | Discard delta log. | None (blocks GC'd if unused). | O(1) operation. |

## Enabling Snapshots
Snapshots must be explicitly enabled on directories by an administrator (superuser). Once enabled, directory owners can manage snapshots.

### Admin Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot <path>` | Mark a directory as snapshottable. | `hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /data` |
| `hdfs dfsadmin -disallowSnapshot <path>` | Disable snapshots (requires deleting all existing ones first). | `hdfs dfsadmin -disallowSnapshot /data` |
| `hdfs dfsadmin -provisionSnapshotTrash <path> [-all]` | Set up trash for snapshot deletions (prevents immediate permanent loss). | `hdfs dfsadmin -provisionSnapshotTrash /data` |

- **Restrictions**: No nested snapshottable directories (ancestors/descendants cannot both be snapshottable). The directory cannot be deleted/renamed while snapshots exist.
- **Java API Equivalents**: `HdfsAdmin.allowSnapshot(Path)`, etc.

## Managing Snapshots (User Commands)
Directory owners can create, delete, and rename snapshots. Maximum per directory: 65,536 (configurable).

| Command | Description | Example | Requirements |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `hdfs dfs -createSnapshot <path> [<name>]` | Create a snapshot (auto-name if omitted: `sYYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.SSS`). | `hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data s1` | Directory owner |
| `hdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot <path> <name>` | Delete a snapshot. | `hdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot /data s1` | Directory owner |
| `hdfs dfs -renameSnapshot <path> <oldName> <newName>` | Rename a snapshot. | `hdfs dfs -renameSnapshot /data s1 s2` | Directory owner |
| `hdfs lsSnapshot <path>` | List snapshots in a directory. | `hdfs lsSnapshot /data` | Read access |
| `hdfs lsSnapshottableDir` | List all snapshottable directories (user-visible ones). | `hdfs lsSnapshottableDir` | None (user's view) |

- **Accessing Snapshots**: Use paths like `/data/.snapshot/s1/file.txt`. Supports standard ops: `ls`, `cat`, `cp` (use `-p` to preserve metadata).
- **Example Copy from Snapshot**: `hdfs dfs -cp -p /data/.snapshot/s1/file.txt /backup/`
- **Java API Equivalents**: `FileSystem.createSnapshot(Path, String)`, etc.

## Snapshot Diff Reports
Compare changes between snapshots or a snapshot vs. current state (use `.` for current).

| Command | Description | Example Output Legend |
|---------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `hdfs snapshotDiff <path> <fromSnapshot> [<toSnapshot>]` | Generate diff report. | `+` (created), `-` (deleted), `M` (modified), `R` (renamed) |
| Example: `hdfs snapshotDiff /data s1 s2` | Shows changes from s1 to s2. | Paths listed with status; renames shown on original path. |

- **Rename Handling**: Intra-directory renames show as `R`; cross-directory as separate create/delete.
- **Java API**: `DistributedFileSystem.getSnapshotDiffReport(Path, String, String)`

## Configuration Options
Edit `hdfs-site.xml` on NameNode. Restart required.

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `dfs.namenode.snapshot.max-num-snapshots` | Hard limit on snapshots per directory. | 65536 |
| `dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-snapshot-retain-count` | Snapshots retained during NameNode checkpointing. | 0 (unlimited) |
| `dfs.namenode.snapshot.enabled` | Globally enable/disable snapshots. | true |
| `dfs.namenode.name.dir` | NameNode metadata dirs (snapshots add to these). | N/A |

No extra config needed for basic use.

## Limitations and Considerations
| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Nesting Forbidden** | Cannot snapshot a directory if parent/child is snapshottable. |
| **Reserved Path** | `.snapshot` cannot be a regular directory name; rename existing ones before upgrading Hadoop. |
| **Diff Accuracy** | Renames outside directory treated as delete/create; order of operations not preserved. |
| **Deletion Semantics** | Without trash provisioning, deletions are permanent (no HDFS trash for snapshots). |
| **Upgrade Impact** | Pre-snapshot Hadoop versions may conflict with `.snapshot` paths. |
| **Scalability** | High snapshot counts increase NameNode memory (deltas); monitor via web UI. |

## Best Practices
- **Automation**: Script periodic snapshots (e.g., cron jobs) for backups.
- **Retention**: Use diff reports to identify and prune old snapshots.
- **Monitoring**: Check NameNode logs for snapshot-related errors; use `hdfs dfsadmin -report` for space usage.
- **Recovery**: To restore, copy files from snapshot paths to current directory.
- **Production Tip**: Combine with HDFS Federation/HA for large-scale use.

# HDFS NameNode High Availability: In-Depth Guide

HDFS NameNode High Availability (HA) addresses the single point of failure in traditional HDFS clusters by deploying multiple NameNodes in an Active/Standby configuration. This ensures seamless failover during hardware failures, software issues, or maintenance, maintaining cluster availability without data loss. HA was introduced in Hadoop 2.0 and is a standard feature in Hadoop 3.x and later. The Active NameNode handles all client operations and metadata updates, while Standby NameNodes remain synchronized and ready to take over.

Key principles:
- **Shared State**: Edit logs (namespace changes) are shared across NameNodes for synchronization.
- **Fencing**: Mechanisms prevent "split-brain" scenarios where multiple NameNodes act as Active simultaneously.
- **No Secondary NameNode**: Standby NameNodes perform checkpointing duties.

HA supports up to five NameNodes (typically two or three) and requires no changes to DataNodes or clients.

## HA Architectures: QJM vs. NFS

Two primary methods for shared edit log storage: Quorum Journal Manager (QJM) and NFS. QJM is recommended for production due to its resilience.

| Aspect | Quorum Journal Manager (QJM) | NFS |
|--------|------------------------------|-----|
| **Shared Storage** | Distributed across 3+ JournalNodes (quorum-based consensus). | Single shared NFS directory. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | High; tolerates failure of minority JournalNodes. | Lower; NFS server is a SPOF. |
| **Complexity** | Higher (manages JournalNodes and ZooKeeper). | Simpler (leverages existing NFS). |
| **Scalability** | Excellent for large clusters. | Limited by NFS performance. |
| **Pros** | Redundant, no single failure point in storage. | Easy setup, low overhead. |
| **Cons** | More components to manage. | NFS bottlenecks; less resilient. |
| **Use Case** | Production environments. | Small/dev clusters with NFS infra. |

QJM is the focus below; NFS details are in the comparison.

## QJM-Based HA: Architecture and Components

QJM uses a quorum of JournalNodes (JNs) to store edit logs durably and consistently.

### Components
- **NameNodes (2â€“5)**: Active processes operations; Standbys mirror state.
- **JournalNodes (3+ odd number)**: Lightweight servers storing edit segments; require majority quorum for writes/reads.
- **ZooKeeper Quorum (3â€“5 nodes)**: For automatic failover; handles leader election and health monitoring.
- **ZKFailoverController (ZKFC)**: Daemon per NameNode; pings ZooKeeper and manages transitions.
- **DataNodes**: Heartbeat to all NameNodes; no special config needed beyond listing all NameNodes.

Data flow: Active NameNode writes edits to a majority of JNs; Standbys tail the logs to sync. Failover involves the new Active applying all pending edits before serving requests.

## Configuration

Configure in `hdfs-site.xml` (NameNodes and JNs) and `core-site.xml` (clients). Distribute configs cluster-wide. Key properties:

| Property | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `dfs.nameservices` | Logical nameservice ID. | `mycluster` |
| `dfs.ha.namenodes.mycluster` | Comma-separated NameNode IDs. | `nn1,nn2` |
| `dfs.namenode.rpc-address.mycluster.nn1` | RPC address for nn1. | `nn1.example.com:8020` |
| `dfs.namenode.http-address.mycluster.nn1` | HTTP address for nn1 (web UI). | `nn1.example.com:9870` |
| `dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir` | QJM URI for shared edits. | `qjournal://jn1:8485;jn2:8485;jn3:8485/mycluster` |
| `dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.mycluster` | Failover proxy for clients. | `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider` |
| `dfs.ha.fencing.methods` | Comma-separated fencing methods (prevents split-brain). | `sshfence` |
| `dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files` | SSH key for fencing (if using sshfence). | `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` |
| `dfs.journalnode.edits.dir` | Local dir for JN edits storage. | `/path/to/jn/edits` |
| `dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled` | Enable auto-failover (requires ZooKeeper). | `true` |
| `ha.zookeeper.quorum` (core-site.xml) | ZooKeeper hosts. | `zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181` |
| `fs.defaultFS` (core-site.xml) | Default FS URI. | `hdfs://mycluster` |

Additional: Set `dfs.ha.nn.not-become-active-in-safemode` to `true` to block Active transition during safemode.

Prerequisites: Hadoop 2.0+, secure SSH for fencing, equivalent hardware for NameNodes.

## Startup Procedure

1. **Format HDFS** (on first NameNode, if new cluster): `hdfs namenode -format`.
2. **Start JournalNodes** (on JN hosts): `hdfs --daemon start journalnode`.
3. **Initialize Shared Edits** (on Active NameNode): `hdfs namenode -initializeSharedEdits`.
4. **Bootstrap Standby** (on each Standby): `hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby`.
5. **Start NameNodes**: `hdfs --daemon start namenode` (on all NN hosts).
6. **Format ZooKeeper** (once, for auto-failover): `hdfs zkfc -formatZK`.
7. **Start ZKFC**: `hdfs --daemon start zkfc` (on all NN hosts).
8. **Start DataNodes**: `hdfs --daemon start datanode`.

Verify: `hdfs haadmin -getServiceState mycluster/nn1` (should show "active" for one, "standby" for others).

## Failover Mechanisms

### Manual Failover
- Graceful switch for maintenance: Use `hdfs haadmin -failover mycluster/nn1 mycluster/nn2`.
- Transition specific NN: `hdfs haadmin -transitionToActive mycluster/nn1` or `-transitionToStandby`.
- Ensures sync before switch; minimal downtime (<1s).

### Automatic Failover
- ZKFC pings ZooKeeper every second; session expiry (default 5s) triggers detection.
- Healthy ZKFC claims ZooKeeper lock, fences old Active, applies edits, becomes Active.
- Config: Enable via `dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled=true`; tune `ha.failover-controller.active-standby-elector.zk.op-retry-interval` for retries.
- Fallback: Manual if ZooKeeper fails.

Fencing ensures old Active aborts (e.g., via SSH kill or script).

## Administration Commands

Use `hdfs haadmin` for management (run as HDFS superuser).

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `hdfs haadmin -getServiceState <nameservice>/<nnid>` | Get state (active/standby). | `hdfs haadmin -getServiceState mycluster/nn1` |
| `hdfs haadmin -getAllServiceState` | States for all NNs. | `hdfs haadmin -getAllServiceState` |
| `hdfs haadmin -failover <from> <to>` | Manual failover. | `hdfs haadmin -failover mycluster/nn1 mycluster/nn2` |
| `hdfs haadmin -transitionToActive <nameservice>/<nnid>` | Force to Active. | `hdfs haadmin -transitionToActive mycluster/nn1` |
| `hdfs haadmin -transitionToStandby <nameservice>/<nnid>` | Force to Standby. | `hdfs haadmin -transitionToStandby mycluster/nn1` |
| `hdfs haadmin -checkHealth <nameservice>/<nnid>` | Health check. | `hdfs haadmin -checkHealth mycluster/nn1` |
| `hdfs haadmin -getFailoverProxyProvider <nameservice>` | Show proxy provider. | `hdfs haadmin -getFailoverProxyProvider mycluster` |

List all: `hdfs haadmin` (no args).

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues
- **Sync Failure**: Check JN logs; ensure majority JNs alive. Verify `dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir` URI.
- **Failover Stalls**: Inspect ZKFC logs for ZooKeeper connectivity; test fencing manually.
- **Safemode Loop**: Set `dfs.ha.nn.not-become-active-in-safemode=true`.
- **Split-Brain**: Always configure fencing; monitor with `hdfs haadmin -checkHealth`.

### Best Practices
- Use 3 JNs and 3 ZooKeeper nodes for quorum.
- Monitor via NameNode web UI (ports 9870+); integrate with tools like Ambari/Cloudera Manager.
- Test failovers regularly in staging.
- For upgrades: Roll via manual failover; sync FsImages.
- Security: Enable Kerberos; use ACLs.
- Limitations: ZooKeeper adds dependency; manual failover needs admin access.

For NFS-specific setup, see the comparison aboveâ€”it's simpler but less robust.
