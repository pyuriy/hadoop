### Comprehensive Hands-On Lab Guide for Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is a unified analytics platform built on Apache Spark, integrated with Azure services for big data processing, machine learning, and data engineering. If you're looking for a comprehensive lab to get hands-on experience, I'll outline a structured approach based on high-quality, free resources. These include step-by-step tutorials, notebooks, and exercises that cover everything from basics to advanced topics like Delta Lake, MLflow, and streaming.

The most comprehensive self-paced lab series I recommend is the **Azure Databricks Hands-on Tutorials** repository on GitHub, which provides a full progression of exercises with importable notebooks. It's designed for Azure environments and assumes a Premium workspace. Below, I'll detail it, followed by other complementary resources.

#### Primary Recommendation: Azure Databricks Hands-on Tutorials (GitHub Repo)
This repository offers 13 progressive labs that build practical skills in PySpark, Spark DataFrames, machine learning pipelines, streaming, and more. It's ideal for beginners to intermediate users, with clear prerequisites and setup instructions.

**Prerequisites:**
- Create an Azure Databricks workspace (Premium plan recommended for ML features).
- Set up a compute cluster with ML runtime (e.g., 10.4 LTS ML).
- Import notebooks from the repo into your workspace.

**Lab Overview (in Recommended Order):**

| Lab # | Topic | Key Activities Covered |
|-------|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | Storage Settings | Configure Azure storage (e.g., Blob or ADLS Gen2) for data access in Databricks. |
| 2 | Basics of PySpark, Spark DataFrame, and Spark ML | Load data, manipulate DataFrames, and run basic ML models with PySpark. |
| 3 | Spark Machine Learning Pipeline | Build end-to-end ML pipelines using Spark MLlib. |
| 4 | Hyper-parameter Tuning | Use CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit for model optimization. |
| 5 | MLeap | Serialize and serve Spark ML models with MLeap (requires ML runtime). |
| 6 | Spark PyTorch Distributor | Implement distributed deep learning with PyTorch on Spark clusters. |
| 7 | Structured Streaming (Basic) | Process real-time data streams with Spark Structured Streaming. |
| 8 | Structured Streaming with Azure Event Hubs or Kafka | Integrate streaming with Azure Event Hubs or Kafka sources/sinks. |
| 9 | Delta Lake | Create ACID-compliant tables, handle schema evolution, and optimize with Z-ordering. |
| 10 | MLflow | Track experiments, log parameters/metrics, and manage models with MLflow. |
| 11 | Orchestration with Azure Data Services | Schedule jobs and integrate with Azure Data Factory/Synapse. |
| 12 | Delta Live Tables | Build declarative ETL pipelines with data quality checks. |
| 13 | Databricks SQL | Query data using SQL warehouses and visualize results. |

**How to Get Started:**
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tsmatz/azure-databricks-exercise`.
2. In your Databricks workspace, go to Workspace > Import, and upload the `.dbc` files or notebooks.
3. Start with Lab 1 to set up storage, then proceed sequentially.
4. Each lab includes code snippets, explanations, and expected outputsâ€”experiment by modifying datasets or parameters.

This series typically takes 10-20 hours to complete and directly applies to real-world Azure scenarios.

#### Complementary Resources for Deeper or Official Training
For a broader learning path, combine the above with these official and guided labs. They include interactive modules, videos, and demos.

| Resource | Description | Format & Duration | Link |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| **Microsoft Learn: Explore Azure Databricks** | Official module covering workspace provisioning, core workloads (e.g., ETL, ML), and Unity Catalog for governance. Builds foundational knowledge; no explicit code labs but includes quizzes and architecture diagrams. | Interactive module (1-2 hours) | [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-databricks/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-databricks/) |
| **Databricks Academy Free Training** | Access customer-level courses on Spark fundamentals, Delta Lake, and MLflow via your workspace. Includes recorded webinars and quarterly roadmaps; some have hands-on components with downloadable `.dbc` notebooks for import. | Self-paced courses & webinars (varies, 2-8 hours each) | [customer-academy.databricks.com/learn](https://customer-academy.databricks.com/learn) (sign in with Azure Databricks account) |
| **Databricks Demo Center: Solution Accelerators** | Pre-built notebooks for high-impact use cases like data migration, fraud detection, and customer 360. Azure-specific integrations included; great for PoC-style labs. | Guided notebooks & best practices (2-4 hours per accelerator) | [databricks.com/resources/demos](https://www.databricks.com/resources/demos) |
| **Databricks Masterclass (YouTube)** | Video-based tutorial from zero to hero, covering cluster setup, notebooks, ETL, and Delta Lake. Includes code walkthroughs for Azure setups. | Video series (4-6 hours total) | [youtube.com/watch?v=7pee6_Sq3VY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pee6_Sq3VY) |
| **UnoGeeks Databricks Hands-On Guide** | Beginner-friendly overview with tips on lab selection (e.g., data engineering vs. ML). References a Day 1 demo video; encourages code experimentation. | Article + video (1 hour) | [unogeeks.com/databricks-hands-on-lab/](https://unogeeks.com/databricks-hands-on-lab/) |

#### Tips for Success
- **Environment Setup:** Start with a free Azure trial if needed. Use small clusters (e.g., 2-4 workers) to keep costs low.
- **Troubleshooting:** Refer to the Azure Databricks Knowledge Base for common issues like cluster configs.
- **Next Steps:** After these labs, pursue certifications like Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate, which includes Databricks scenarios.
- **Community Support:** Join the Databricks Community forums for exercise-specific help.
